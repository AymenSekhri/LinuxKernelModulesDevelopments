# Linux Kernel Modules Developments
 This repo will go through my journey of reading about linux kernel modules.<br>
 For this i will be using VSCode in Windows to ssh and execute kernel modules in Ubuntu 18.04 TLS (Kernel 5.3.0-42-generic), Ubuntu is hosted on VMWare Player.<br>
 I know, coding for Linux on Windows lol, who does this? me, because i'm stupid enough! and i'm not fan of linux :/.
 For this journey i'm bouncing through three books :
 * Linux Kernel Development Third Edition by Robert Love.
 * Linux Driver Development for Embedded Processors Second Edition by Alberto Liberal del los Rios.
 * Linux Device Drivers Third Edition by Jonathan Corbet.
